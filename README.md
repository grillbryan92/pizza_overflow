# pizza_overflow

For the Data Engineer challenge I used a local mysql database and created a schema/database called PizzaOverflow.\
Run 'table_dumps.sql' to create and populates all tables.\
The file 'resports.sql' contains 2 querys for the given reports specified in the comments. It would have been much easier if the table 'orders' had a unique id such as an incremental, this forced me to generate an id temporarily over the query.

For the Big Data challenge I wrote and ran the code using Spyder (python3.8).
The IDE highlights lines 57 and 59 as if the functions where not defined but it executes completely fine.
